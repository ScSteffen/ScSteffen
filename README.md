### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

this github features my work on various projects including

- ðŸ”­ ![neuralEntropyClosures](https://github.com/ScSteffen/neuralEntropyClosures), a project to fuse deep neural networks with high performance numerical solvers for particle transport. The work is summarized in the ICML2022 contribution, which can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10364)

- ðŸ”­ ![DLRT](https://github.com/CSMMLab/DLRANet), and [Tucker-DLRT](https://github.com/emabuell/Tucker-DLRT) a novel approach for adaptive low-rank neural network training and model compression. The work is summarized in the NeurIPS2022 contribution, which can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13571).

- ðŸ”­ ![KiT-RT](https://github.com/CSMMLab/KiT-RT), an high performance radiation transport simulator and multi purpose numerical toolkit. You can also [read the docs]( https://kit-rt.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html). The preprint can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08417).

- ðŸ”­ ![SU2](https://github.com/su2code/SU2), a multi-physics optimization and CFD suite. Check out the official [website](https://su2code.github.io/). My contribution is summarized in the [AIAA Journal](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.J059983?af=R&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound).

- ðŸ”­ ![Flowmachine](https://github.com/CSMMLab/Flowmachine), a deep-learning based prediction of continuum breakdown of rarefied gas flows with a hybrid flow-solver. The preprint can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02933).
