### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

this github features my work on various projects including

- ðŸ”­ ![neuralEntropyClosures](https://github.com/ScSteffen/neuralEntropyClosures), a project to fuse deep neural networks with high performance numerical solvers for particle transport. Also my PhD project ;).
- ðŸ”­ ![KiT-RT](https://github.com/CSMMLab/KiT-RT), an high performance radiation transport simulator and multi purpose numerical toolkit. You can also [read the docs]( https://kit-rt.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html).
- ðŸ”­ ![SU2](https://github.com/su2code/SU2), a multi-physics optimization and CFD suite. Check out the official [website](https://su2code.github.io/).


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything possible about modern neural network architectures, fast and realiable code to compute hard problems and other stuff during my PhD at [KIT Karlsruhe](https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/aboutus/rg-csmm.php).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... cool scientific computing projects. Bonus points if it contains parallel computing or machine learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about partial differential equations, kinetic solvers, neural networks and their applications.
